            <p>

              and its Services at the User’s own risk and under the User’s
              responsibility and, therefore, the Company does not accept any

                When all of the above conditions are met, the User shall be
                entitled to authorize a third party to use the relevant content
                in the lakshmisilks Content. This exception refers only to the
                prohibition for the User to authorize third parties to use the
                content in the lakshmisilks Content without affecting or
                limiting in any way the remaining conditions of the User’s right
                to use the lakshmisilks Content. Whether the above conditions
                regarding the exception to the prohibition for Users to

                10. Conditions for the Premium Subscription
              </h4>
              <p>
                The terms in this Section ("<strong
                  >Premium Subscription Terms</strong
                >") govern any purchase of the Premium Subscription in the
                Website. When concluding the purchase procedure for any Premium
                Subscription, it shall be deemed that the User has read and
                accepted, without exception, the Premium Subscription Terms. For
                the avoidance of doubt, the Premium Subscription Terms are
                additional to the Terms which will continue to apply to Users
                who have acquired a Premium Subscription unless it is expressly
                provided otherwise in relation to specific provisions in the
                Premium Subscription Terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                These Premium Subscription Terms are available to the User
                before the purchase of the Premium Subscription and may be
                stored or reproduced on a durable medium.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Premium Subscription Terms are available in English and
                Spanish. In case the User is interested in purchasing any
                Premium Subscription, it has to follow the instructions
                available in the Website from time to time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Subscriptions available are offered in the Website where the
                pertinent customercarermation, price and conditions are included
                (including, without limitation, restrictions to the number of
                downloads each day). The Company can modify the Subscriptions
                offered at any time, offering with new Services (to which,
                unless otherwise stated, these Subscription Terms shall apply)
                or ceasing to offer any of the Services. The Subscriptions are
                personal, shall not be assigned to third parties and no third
                parties other than the User shall be allowed to use the
                lakshmisilks Content (including as third parties, for these
                purposes, affiliates or entities part of the same group of
                companies).
              </p>
              <p>
                The price for the Subscription is stated in the relevant
                currency in the Website and includes, if applicable, the
                relevant Value Added Tax. The Company is entitled to modify the
                price for any Subscription at any time. The Company shall apply
                the price stated in the Website at the time of the submission of
                the Subscription order by the User.
              </p>
              <p>
                The User shall pay the Premium Subscription in advance through
                Paypal, credit/debit card or any other valid payment method
                offered by the Company, as stated in the Website. To purchase
                and pay the Premium Subscription, the User shall follow the
                instructions stated in the Website. The processing of the
                payment customercarermation and data through Paypal or
                credit/debit card is made within third-party sites. When
                ordering any Premium Subscription, the User authorizes the
                Company to collect the corresponding price through the chosen
                payment method. The Premium Subscription shall not be activated
                until the Company has received the payment or the payment has
                been authorized by the relevant financing entity. After that,
                the Premium Subscription shall be in force for the term
                purchased by the User.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unless otherwise stated in these Premium Subscription Terms, the
                Premium Subscriptions shall be automatically and successively
                renewed at the expiration of its term, unless the User cancels
                the renewal of the Premium Subscription before its expiration.
                The Company shall charge the corresponding price by the same
                initial payment method. The Company may modify the price for the
                renewal of the Premium Subscription, provided that the User is
                customercarermed with, at least, one-month prior notice, via
                email sent to the email address used for the registration
                process.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the User purchases the Premium Subscription, the screen
                shall confirm the purchase. In addition, within the shortest
                time reasonably possible and not after twenty-four (24) hours
                since the acceptance of the order, an email shall be sent to the
                User with the receipt of the purchase. The receipt may be stored
                and printed. The User may request and download an invoice as
                stated within the Website twenty-four (24) hours after making
                the relevant payment.
              </p>
              <p>
