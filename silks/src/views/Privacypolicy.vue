              <h4 class="font-xl">8. Data security</h4>
              <p>
                We have implemented strong security controls to safeguard Userâ€™s
                personal information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access,
                disclosure or alteration.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, to protect your personal data, Secure Socket Layer
                (SSL) technology is used during the transmission of data. This
                means that an approved encryption procedure is used for
                communication between your computer or device and lakshmisilks's
                servers, as long as your browser supports SSL.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div id="priv-transfer">
              <h4 class="font-xl">9. International data transfers</h4>
              <p>
                We carry out international data transfers in relationship with
                some of the processing described in the previous clause with
                certain data processors: subcontractors and content delivery
                networks to help us to deliver our Services.
              </p>
              <p>
                A data processor, as already said, is an external subcontractor
                that we hire, and that may have access to personal data about
                users or collaborators, or that stores them in the context of
                the service provided to us.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of these external service providers are located outside of
                the Indian Economic Area (IEA), so the processing of your
                personal data involves an international data transfer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our international data transfers can occur to countries with a
                level of protection of personal data potentially lower than that
                imposed by the RGPD. Said international data transfers are
                covered by standard contractual clauses (art 46.2.c) GDPR).
